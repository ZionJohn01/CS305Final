# CS305Final

Q: Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
A: Artemis Financial is a consulting company that assists their clients with investing, saving, retirement, and any other kind of individualized financial plans. They requested a RESTful web application that provided secure transportation of information.

Q: What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
A: When developing a product for a client it is important to acknowledge every possible vulnerability that they might run into. Whether that be data concerns, security concerns, etc. Discussing in detail the requirements and plans that the client intends is key to developing a great product. If the client has a great product, then their clients will be happy with the product as well.

Q: What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
A: Learning to navigate and investigate vulnerabilities during the assessment was tricky at first. Also, initially I ran into several errors trying to get the vulnerability assessment to even run. As it turns out, it was a simple typo.

Q: How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
A: After investigation of some of the vulnerabilities it seemed that many of the dependencies just needed to be updated. This resolved several issues we ran into initially. As for the future of my testing, I plan to continue using the vulnerability assessment in my future projects.

Q: How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
A: To check after refactoring the code if I had introduced any new vulnerabilties I ran the assessment again, and compared it to the initial report. I also ran a few tests with different strings as well as reversing the checksum to see if it came back correctly.

Q: What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
A: I ran the application a lot... like a lot a lot. Everytime that I would add anything I would run the application to see if I had broken anything. I believe most developers do this but I took this to an extreme level as when I initially started the application refused to cooperate at all. I also read a lot of documentation during the making of this project. It helped immensely in my understanding of the innerworkings of what I actually was developing.

Q: Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
A: I believe I would show them the codebase. I am very proud of how clean and resourceful I was in developing this project. I was also able to take an existing codebase and add onto it. This would indicate that I could work easily with a team in the development cycle.
